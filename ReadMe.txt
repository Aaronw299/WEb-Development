For the discount in this project I've used a combination of the PPSN checksum and the Spanish DNI checksum. Entering a correct value for either one will result in a discount and a friendly message afterwards.

For the telephone number checksum validateTel() the final number must be equal to the sum of the first 3 numbers + 1 and divided by 2.

Example 1: 0873624938

0+8+7 = 15 + 1 = 16/2 = 8 final digit is 8 so telephone number is valid.

Example 2: 0833624933

0+8+3 = 11 + 1 = 12/2 = 6 final digit is 3 so telephone number is invalid.


I rely on HTML 5 to validate the email and that only numbers can be entered into both mobile numbers and credit card inputs.
